Watch any video together with friends.

**Note: until our UI is finished, the Chrome Web Store may be outdated**

Play a video on any streaming site, and playback & play/pause will
stay synchronized across all your friends. Just make sure everyone
has the extension.

1. Tell everyone to install the Stream Together extension
2. Launch any video on any streaming service
3. Click the Stream Together button in your browser toolbar, and leave the Host ID blank
4. Share the link with your group
5. Have each friend click the Stream Together buttonâ€”it should automatically enter the ID.

You should get a notification as your friends join the party.

Supported websites:

-   Netflix
-   Amazon Prime Video
-   Disney+
-   YouTube
-   Les Mills On Demand
-   more we don't know about! Reach out to add to our list, or to let
    us know of a site that isn't working the way it should.
